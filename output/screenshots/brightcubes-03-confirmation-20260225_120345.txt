I am excited to apply for the AI/ML Engineer position at Bright Cubes. I am currently building CogitatAI, an AI chatbot platform featuring sentiment analysis and NLP capabilities, demonstrating hands-on experience with ML in production. At ASML, I developed Python-based software solutions for high-tech systems, and I have extensive experience with Azure cloud infrastructure including CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native deployments. My BSc from Fontys University of Applied Sciences (ICT - Software Engineering) and my strong passion for AI/ML make me a great fit for this role. I am eager to join Bright Cubes and help clients derive real value from their data.
