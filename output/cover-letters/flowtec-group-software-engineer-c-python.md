Dear Flowtec Group Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer (C++ & Python) position. The opportunity to design and optimize robotic software for material handling systems combines my two core interests: Python development and industrial automation.

At Actemium (VINCI Energies) in Eindhoven, I develop software solutions for Manufacturing Execution Systems that bridge software and industrial hardware. This hands-on experience with manufacturing automation, combined with my Python internship at ASML where I built test frameworks for high-tech mechatronic systems, gives me a strong foundation for Flowtec's robotics-focused software development.

My technical toolkit includes Python, Flask, REST APIs, Azure, and CI/CD — and I am eager to deepen my C++ skills in your context. I bring an understanding of how software interacts with hardware and sensors from my MES work, and my agile experience at ASML prepared me for collaborative, fast-paced development environments.

I am based in Eindhoven and available to discuss how my background in Python and industrial software can contribute to Flowtec's robotics team.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
