Dear KUBUS/BIMcollab Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Software Engineer position at KUBUS. Building tools that allow architects, engineers, and builders to explore BIM models without heavy desktop software is an exciting challenge that combines cloud development with practical impact.

At Actemium (VINCI Energies), I work with .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and JavaScript to build full-stack applications and API integrations. My experience with Azure cloud services, database optimization, and agile development practices aligns well with your .NET-based cloud SaaS platform.

I am based in Eindhoven, walking distance from Central Station where your office is located, and hold a valid Dutch work permit.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
