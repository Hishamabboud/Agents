Dear Hiring Team at CM.com,

I am applying for the Full Stack Developer position at CM.com in Arnhem, specifically for the Mobile Service Cloud team. The opportunity to work on an AI-powered customer engagement platform at such scale — millions of conversations, thousands of service agents — is genuinely exciting to me.

In my current role as Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I develop and maintain backend applications using C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and SQL for industrial clients. I build cloud-native solutions on Azure, work with Docker and Kubernetes in CI/CD pipelines, and regularly solve complex technical problems in production environments. This stack maps almost exactly to what the Mobile Service Cloud team uses.

Beyond my day job, I founded CogitatAI — an AI-powered chatbot platform with personality-adaptive responses and sentiment analysis. Building and deploying this independently gave me experience with the exact convergence of AI and customer engagement that CM.com is pursuing with HALO. I understand firsthand the engineering challenges of building conversational AI systems that need to perform reliably at scale.

What resonates with me in CM.com's culture is the "do what you love, do what you're good at" philosophy and the honest acknowledgment that AI will reshape roles rapidly. I am someone who embraces that change — I actively study LLMs and automation tools, and I see AI as an accelerant for engineering, not a threat.

I am fluent in both Dutch and English, have a permanent residence and work permit in the Netherlands (BSc from Fontys, employed at Actemium in Eindhoven), and am available for on-site collaboration in Arnhem.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
