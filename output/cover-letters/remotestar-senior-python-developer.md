Dear Remotestar Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Senior Python Developer (Remote) position. The opportunity to architect, design, and implement software in a creative, dynamic remote role is very appealing.

At Actemium in Eindhoven, I build applications using Python/Flask alongside .NET and JavaScript. My Python experience at ASML, where I developed automated test frameworks with Locust and Pytest for semiconductor systems, demonstrates my ability to architect reliable Python solutions. I also founded CogitatAI, an AI-powered platform built entirely with Python/Flask on cloud infrastructure.

I bring strong remote work capabilities, Azure/Docker/Kubernetes experience, and fluency in English and Dutch. I am available for remote work from the Netherlands.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
