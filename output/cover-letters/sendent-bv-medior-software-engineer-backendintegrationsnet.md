Dear Sendent B.V. Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Medior Software Engineer (Backend/Integrations/.NET) position. Sendent's focus on sustainable software, privacy-first design, and real ownership aligns well with my professional values and career goals.

As a Software Service Engineer at Actemium in Eindhoven, I work daily with C#/.NET building and maintaining production integrations for industrial clients. I develop API connections, optimize databases, and troubleshoot complex issues in live environments — exactly the kind of backend ownership your Exchange Connector requires. My experience migrating legacy codebases (Visual Basic to C#) at Delta Electronics demonstrates my ability to work with unfamiliar code and improve it methodically.

I also bring strong testing experience from my internship at ASML, where I built automated test suites with Pytest and Locust, and worked with Git-based CI/CD workflows in an agile environment. My graduation project on GDPR data anonymization gave me direct exposure to privacy and compliance concerns — relevant to Sendent's mission of data sovereignty.

I am based in Eindhoven with a valid Dutch work permit and am comfortable with hybrid work. I would value the opportunity to grow by owning real software at Sendent.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
