Dear Prodrive Technologies Recruitment Team,

I am applying for a Software Engineer position at Prodrive Technologies. Your mission of creating meaningful technologies that make the world work aligns with my passion for building software that has real-world impact in high-tech manufacturing.

Currently at Actemium (VINCI Energies) in Eindhoven, I develop software solutions for Manufacturing Execution Systems using .NET, C#, Python, and JavaScript. I work at the intersection of software and manufacturing processes — building integrations, optimizing systems, and troubleshooting production environments. Previously at ASML in Veldhoven, I built automated test frameworks with Python for semiconductor equipment, giving me direct experience in the Eindhoven high-tech ecosystem.

I bring a blend of software engineering skills (Python, C#, .NET, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes) and manufacturing domain knowledge that is well-suited for Prodrive's multi-disciplinary R&D environment. My entrepreneurial initiative with CogitatAI demonstrates my drive to build innovative solutions beyond my day job.

I am based in Eindhoven and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Prodrive Technologies' software engineering team.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
