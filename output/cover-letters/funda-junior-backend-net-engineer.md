Dear Hiring Team at Funda,

I am writing to apply for the Junior Backend .NET Engineer position at Funda in Amsterdam. The opportunity to work on the platform used by millions of Dutch people to find their next home is genuinely exciting — and the tech stack (.NET 8, Azure, Kubernetes, microservices) is exactly what I work with professionally.

As Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I build backend applications in C#, ASP.NET, and .NET for industrial clients, implementing API integrations and database optimizations. I work within scrum teams, write unit tests, and collaborate on code reviews. During my internship at ASML, I worked with Azure and Kubernetes in a CI/CD pipeline environment, which aligns directly with Funda's tooling.

One project I am particularly proud of is my GDPR Data Anonymization Solution, developed for Fontys ICT Cyber Security Research Group. I designed and implemented a pipeline that enabled secure cross-organization data sharing while maintaining full regulatory compliance — a project that required careful architectural thinking and robust backend design.

What draws me to Funda is the mentorship structure: learning from experienced engineers while taking on increasing responsibility, from the first pull request to owning features in production. I am ready for that growth path and will bring genuine enthusiasm to it.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University, am based in Eindhoven, and have no notice period constraints. My current .NET/Azure experience puts me well beyond a pure junior level, but I welcome the collaborative learning environment Funda describes.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
