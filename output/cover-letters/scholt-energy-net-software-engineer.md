Dear Recruitment Team at Scholt Energy,

I am writing to express my interest in the .NET Software Engineer position at Scholt Energy. Your mission toward climate-neutral energy for all businesses is compelling, and I am eager to contribute to intelligent information systems that drive efficiency in the evolving energy market.

In my current role as Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies) in Eindhoven, I design and maintain full-stack applications using .NET, C#, ASP.NET, Python, and JavaScript. I build custom integrations, API connections, and database optimizations for industrial clients — experience that directly maps to your need for a developer who translates strategic objectives into smart information systems. I work daily with Azure, SQL, and integration monitoring in production environments.

Beyond technical skills, I bring multilingual capabilities — fluent in English, Dutch, Arabic, and Persian — valuable for your international team environment. My experience at ASML with Azure, Kubernetes, and CI/CD in agile settings, combined with founding CogitatAI, demonstrates both technical depth and initiative.

I am based in Eindhoven, hold a valid Dutch work permit, and am available for the hybrid arrangement you offer. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my .NET and integration experience can contribute to your development team.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
