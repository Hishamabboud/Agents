Dear Scholt Energy Recruitment Team,

I am applying for the (Senior) Software Engineer .NET/C# position at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. Contributing to smart information systems in the energy sector is an opportunity that matches both my technical background and professional interests.

At Actemium (VINCI Energies), I develop .NET/C# applications and integrations for industrial clients, including system monitoring, root cause analysis, and performance optimization in production environments. This hands-on experience with integration development and system reliability directly aligns with the responsibilities of this role.

I work with Azure, SQL, JavaScript, and CI/CD tools daily, and my background at ASML and Delta Electronics has given me experience across the full software lifecycle. I am fluent in English, Dutch, Arabic, and Persian — an asset for your international team.

I am based in Eindhoven with a valid Dutch work permit and am enthusiastic about contributing to Scholt Energy's mission. I look forward to discussing this opportunity.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
