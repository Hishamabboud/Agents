Dear Ortec Finance Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Software Developer Python position. Building software for the financial sector combines my Python development skills with meaningful impact.

At Actemium, I develop solutions using Python/Flask and .NET for industrial clients. My ASML internship gave me experience building robust Python test frameworks. I bring strong communication skills — fluent in English, Dutch, Arabic, and Persian — and am comfortable commuting from Eindhoven to Rotterdam.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
