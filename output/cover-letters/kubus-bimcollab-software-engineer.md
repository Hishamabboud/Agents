Dear KUBUS/BIMcollab Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Software Engineer position at KUBUS. Building tools that allow architects, engineers, and builders to explore BIM models without heavy desktop software is an exciting challenge that combines cloud development with practical impact.

At Actemium (VINCI Energies), I work with .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and JavaScript to build full-stack applications and API integrations. My experience with Azure cloud services, database optimization, and agile development practices aligns well with your .NET-based cloud SaaS platform. I have a strong backend foundation from building production systems and integrations for manufacturing clients.

My internship at ASML gave me experience working in Azure/Kubernetes environments with CI/CD pipelines, and my work at Delta Electronics included migrating legacy codebases to modern C# — demonstrating my ability to work with existing code and modernize it. I am also comfortable with modern frontend technologies including React and JavaScript.

I am based in Eindhoven, walking distance from Central Station where your office is located, and hold a valid Dutch work permit. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the BIMcollab platform.

Best regards,
Hisham Abboud
