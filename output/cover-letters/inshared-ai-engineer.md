# Cover Letter – AI Engineer at InShared

Dear InShared Hiring Team,

I am applying for the AI Engineer position at InShared in Leusden. Building AI systems that make digital insurance fairer, faster, and easier — on a cloud-native platform that scales to thousands of users daily — is exactly the kind of impactful engineering challenge I am looking for.

My experience with AI engineering comes from building CogitatAI, an AI customer support platform I founded. I developed the Python/Flask backend, integrated LLM APIs, and deployed to cloud infrastructure. This gave me practical experience with the full lifecycle of AI feature development: from architecture decisions through to production reliability, observability, and handling edge cases at scale.

In my current role as a Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I build Python and .NET backend services with Azure cloud deployments and CI/CD pipelines. My engineering is focused on production reliability, maintainable code, and systematic testing — qualities that matter particularly in a sensitive domain like insurance where data accuracy and system reliability are non-negotiable.

At ASML in Veldhoven, I worked in a sophisticated Kubernetes/Azure CI/CD environment building automated test frameworks with Python (Locust, Pytest), gaining experience with distributed systems at scale.

I am a Netherlands resident (Eindhoven) and do not require visa sponsorship. I am excited about InShared's model of fair, technology-first insurance and the scale of the engineering challenges involved in building it.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
