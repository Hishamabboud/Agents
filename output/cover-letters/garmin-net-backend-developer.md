Dear Hiring Manager at Garmin Nederland,

I am writing to apply for the .Net Back End Developer position at Garmin in Leiden. As a software engineer with hands-on experience in C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and Azure, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to the high-performance backend systems that power Garmin's world-class navigation and sports technology products.

In my current role as Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I build and maintain full-stack applications using .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and Python for industrial clients. I develop custom API integrations, work with relational databases, and deploy solutions in cloud environments — all skills directly applicable to this role. Prior to that, during my internship at ASML, I collaborated in an agile, cloud-based environment using Azure and Kubernetes, which gave me solid exposure to enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines and Azure services.

What excites me most about Garmin is the intersection of software engineering with real-world consumer products. I use Garmin devices personally, and the idea of contributing backend systems that support features used by millions of users worldwide is genuinely motivating. Your tech stack — .NET, C#, ASP.NET Core, and Azure — is precisely what I work with daily, so I would hit the ground running.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Sciences and have 1–2 years of professional .NET experience following graduation, aligning well with the 1–6 year range indicated in the posting. I am also fluent in English and available to commute to Leiden or discuss relocation logistics.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm for Garmin's mission can contribute to your team. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
