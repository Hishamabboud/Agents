Dear Hiring Team at Sopra Steria,

I am applying for the .NET Developer position at Sopra Steria in Nieuwegein. Sopra Steria's reputation for delivering high-quality cloud-native solutions for enterprise clients, combined with the opportunity to work on greenfield projects and modernization initiatives, makes this role a strong fit for my background and ambitions.

Currently, I work as a Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), where I develop and maintain applications using .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and Python for manufacturing clients across the Netherlands. My work involves building API integrations, optimizing database performance, and troubleshooting complex issues in production environments — all while working in an agile team. Before this, I interned at ASML, where I developed Python test suites and collaborated in an Azure/Kubernetes-based CI/CD environment.

The role at Sopra Steria aligns well with my skill set: C# and .NET Core are my primary backend languages, I have hands-on Azure experience, and I am comfortable working in DevOps-oriented agile teams. I am particularly enthusiastic about the focus on clean code, architectural participation, and IaC for cloud environments — areas where I actively seek to grow.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Sciences and have more than 2 years of professional development experience since graduation. I am fluent in both Dutch and English, meeting the language requirements for this role. The advertised salary range of €4,000–€6,000 per month aligns with my expectations.

I would be delighted to discuss how my experience and drive can contribute to Sopra Steria's team in the Netherlands. Please find my CV attached.

Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
