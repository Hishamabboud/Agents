# Cover Letter – Software Developer at EY Amsterdam

Dear EY Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Software Developer position in EY's Human Resources department in Amsterdam. The opportunity to design and implement software solutions that enhance HR processes at one of the world's leading professional services firms is a compelling challenge.

In my current role as a Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I build backend services and REST API integrations using .NET/C# and Python/Flask for industrial clients. I work with SQL databases, Azure cloud services, and CI/CD pipelines to deliver maintainable, production-ready software. My ability to collaborate with non-technical stakeholders — understanding their requirements and translating them into clean, scalable software solutions — is directly relevant to building effective HR technology.

At Delta Electronics, I built a web application specifically for HR purposes: a salary adjustment and quarterly budget management system used across multiple branches. This gave me direct experience building HR software that must be intuitive, accurate, and reliable for business-critical processes.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, and I am based in the Netherlands with no visa sponsorship requirements.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
