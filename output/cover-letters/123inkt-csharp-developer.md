Dear Hiring Team at 123inkt,

I am writing to apply for the C# Developer position at 123inkt in Veenendaal. 123inkt's position as a leading Dutch e-commerce specialist for ink, toner, and office supplies, with your own product development team, is an exciting place to apply .NET development skills.

In my current role as Software Service Engineer at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I develop and maintain .NET applications using C#, ASP.NET, and .NET Core, including API integrations with external systems. I have solid experience with relational databases (SQL Server), building scalable backend services, and working in agile teams. At Delta Electronics (internship), I migrated a legacy Visual Basic codebase to C# and built a web application for HR budget management — giving me direct experience with .NET and Microsoft SQL Server.

The role at 123inkt is a strong fit: your stack (.NET 4.7+, .NET Core, C#, Microsoft SQL Server) is exactly what I work with daily, and the marketplace integration aspect (Bol.com, Amazon) is something I find genuinely interesting given my background in API development and system integrations.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Sciences, am fluent in both Dutch and English, and am available for 32-40 hours per week. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the 123inkt development team.

Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
