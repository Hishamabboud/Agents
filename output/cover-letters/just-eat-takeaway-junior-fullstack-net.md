Dear Hiring Team at Just Eat Takeaway.com,

I am applying for the Junior FullStack .Net Software Engineer position within the Platform Engineering domain at Just Eat Takeaway.com in Enschede. The combination of backend-focused .NET development with an interest in AI tooling and engineering metrics aligns perfectly with both my skills and my personal passion for applying AI to software engineering workflows.

In my current role at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I develop backend applications using .NET, C#, ASP.NET, and Python — building reliable systems for manufacturing clients while working in a DevOps-oriented team. I also founded CogitatAI, an AI-powered chatbot platform I built and deployed independently, which directly reflects the curiosity for AI tooling mentioned in your job posting.

My Python experience from my ASML internship (test suite development using Locust/Pytest) complements the scripting and data exploration aspects of this role. I understand REST API design, CI/CD pipelines, and have worked with both frontend (JavaScript/React) and backend technologies throughout my career.

What draws me to Just Eat Takeaway specifically is the scale — contributing to platform engineering that powers food delivery across 20+ countries is a meaningful engineering challenge. I thrive in collaborative, multi-disciplinary environments, and I am excited about the hybrid setup (Enschede, 3 days on-site).

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Sciences and am an EU citizen with full Netherlands work authorization. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the Platform Engineering team.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
