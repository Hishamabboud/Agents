Dear Hiring Team at Channable,

I am writing to apply for the Python Software Engineer position on the Marketplaces team at Channable in Utrecht. Channable's platform — handling hundreds of millions of products and marketplace integrations daily — is exactly the type of technically demanding, high-impact environment I am looking to grow in.

My Python development background spans both professional and personal projects. At ASML, I built high-performance test suites using Locust and Pytest in an agile, Azure-based CI/CD environment. Currently at Actemium, I develop Python/Flask backend applications integrated with REST APIs for industrial clients. Additionally, I founded CogitatAI, an AI-powered chatbot platform I built using Python/Flask with cloud deployment — which gave me direct experience with Flask, REST API design, async patterns, and PostgreSQL.

The Channable tech stack (Python 3, Flask, FastAPI, Pydantic, PostgreSQL, Redis) maps closely to what I use professionally. I am comfortable with Git, Linux, and CI/CD pipelines, and I have experience designing and consuming web APIs — including marketplace-style integrations. I am also familiar with containerized environments through my Azure/Docker/Kubernetes experience at ASML.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering from Fontys University, am an EU citizen with full Netherlands work authorization (no visa required), and am available for at least 40 hours per week. The salary range of €3,900–€5,400 per month aligns with my expectations.

I would love to discuss how I can contribute to the Marketplaces team. Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
