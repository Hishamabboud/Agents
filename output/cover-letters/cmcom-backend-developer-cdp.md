Dear Hiring Team at CM.com,

I am applying for the Backend Developer position on the Customer Data Platform (CDP) team at CM.com in Breda. The CDP — as the backbone powering marketing, customer service, and AI-driven tools like HALO — is a technically challenging system to build and scale, and exactly the kind of high-impact work I am looking for.

My background is in C# backend development: at Actemium (VINCI Energies), I build and maintain .NET/C# Web APIs, implement database optimizations, and develop data integrations for industrial clients. I have solid PostgreSQL/SQL experience, work with microservices architectures, and am familiar with containerization via Docker and Kubernetes. I also have experience with Azure cloud pipelines from my ASML internship, and while I have not used Google Cloud (BigQuery, Bigtable) professionally, I am highly comfortable learning new cloud platforms quickly.

What draws me specifically to the CDP role is the data pipeline aspect. Designing and optimizing pipelines for complex customer data is deeply interesting to me — it combines backend engineering precision with meaningful business impact.

I hold a BSc in Software Engineering, am fluent in Dutch and English, have a permanent Netherlands work and residence permit, and can commute to Breda from Eindhoven (about 50 minutes).

Kind regards,
Hisham Abboud
